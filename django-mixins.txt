# Mixins :

## what is it :
Mixins are a form of multiple inheritance where behaviors and attributes of multiple parent classes can be combined.

## where to use them :
- Provide multiple optional features for a class;
- Use a particular feature in several classes.

## mixins come with some cost :
- The more mixins you use, the harder it will be to read a child class; 
- You can only inherit from one generic view.
